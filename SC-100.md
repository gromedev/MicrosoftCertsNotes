Since I already passed AZ-104 and AZ-500, I thought SC-100 would be a breeze! Turns out there are a lot of terms that were new to me and SC-100 is a lot more "book heavy" than I thought it would be. 

Overall these notes seem to cover most of the questions in the exam.

VIRTUALIZATION
---------------------------------------------------------

A Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) is a secure computer system that is used to perform sensitive tasks, such as managing networks, servers, and other critical infrastructure. It is designed to be more secure than a regular workstation, with additional controls and safeguards in place to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of attacks. Some of the key features of a PAW include:

Secure boot: PAW systems are configured to only boot from a trusted source, such as a hardware-based security module.

Separation of duties: PAW systems are used by privileged users, such as administrators, who have access to sensitive resources. To reduce the risk of abuse, these users are typically required to use separate systems for their day-to-day tasks and for performing privileged activities.

Application whitelisting: PAW systems are configured to only allow specific, trusted applications to run. This helps to prevent the execution of malicious software and other unauthorized programs.

Network isolation: PAW systems are often isolated from the rest of the network to further reduce the risk of compromise.

Auditing and monitoring: PAW systems are configured to generate detailed logs of all activity, and these logs are regularly reviewed to detect any suspicious activity.
